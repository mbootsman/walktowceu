💪🏼 Together we stand for a strong WordPress Community 💪🏼

You're crazy about WordPress. So are we. We've got WordPress stuck in our DNA. That's why we contribute to the community whenever we can. When we heard about Marcel's initiative, we didn't hesitate to contribute. We love his idea to collect money to support WordPressers who don't have the financial means to visit a WordCamp. That's why Marcel can count on our support.

Who are we? [Vevida](https://vevida.com/), uut Grunn!

Sorry, the last two words are in our dialect. We're based in the city of Groningen, in the north of the Netherlands.

We have been in business since 1997, with over 50,000 satisfied customers. We have always distinguished ourselves by combining extensive expertise with attractive prices. Worry-free hosting. That's what we're all about.

At daytime our experts help our customers. When they are not working they contribute to the WordPress community, like our freely available plugin Vevida Optimizer. We follow the latest news, and visit, sponsor and organize WordPress meetups and WordCamps. And of course all our websites proudly run WordPress.
