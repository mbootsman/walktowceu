**Your New Home for Modern Web Apps and Sites**

We love it when people think, or should we say step ðŸ‘Ÿ, outside the box! When our team saw that Marcel was walking to WordCamp Europe, and donating the funds to a good cause, we had to help.

Kinsta was launched in 2013 by a team of WordPress veterans with the goal of providing the best managed WordPress hosting in the industry. Our primary focus is on speed, security, and high-quality support. We are also proud to be a bootstrapped company, where users and feedback come first.

Our team takes performance seriously. We were the first managed WordPress solution exclusively powered by Google Cloud Platform. Users can choose from 19+ global data centers and get access to one of the biggest networks on the planet. The result? Blazing fast load times!

Kinsta hosts all types of sites, from small blogs all the way up to Fortune 500 customers. We've worked with leading brands such as GE, Intuit, MariaDB, Drift, and Buffer. Our auto-scaling and container technology allow for complete isolation of resources. This ensures your business stays online during traffic surges and is secured like Fort Knox.

We literally changed how support works. We donâ€™t have different level tiers as many others do. Our entire team is made up of only the most talented WordPress developers and Linux hosting engineers. We are available 24x7 if you need help.
