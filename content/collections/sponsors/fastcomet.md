We are FastComet, and we are among one of the few privately-owned, independent and rapidly growing global web hosting companies. It all started in 2013, and we evolved ever since into one of the top choices for web hosting service providers. With 70+ employees, operating in 8 data centers around the world, we continue to develop and improve our products portfolio and services thanks to our ever-growing and wonderful team. It has been a great JOURNEY so far and the best is yet to come!

One of the industry events weâ€™ve been actively participating in since our inception has been WordCamps. Building relationships. Sharing experiences. Supporting amazing FEATS like walktowc.eu is a major part of our business philosophy. It is all about connecting and giving back to the wonderful WordPress community. We aim to assist in the forward propulsion of WordPress itself and contribute to its direction and the effort of keeping it RUNNING.
