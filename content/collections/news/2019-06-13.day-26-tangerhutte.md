I followed the B71, an important road for the local towns and cities. I was passed by cars, trucks, buses and two cyclists. I had to go on to the former R71. This road at some point was a dead end because I was in front of an sign. A sign that indicated the area was a military practice area and entering that area without an approval is not allowed.'

We had a short chat, they were from Kansas and were on a trip to Berlin having started in Amsterdam. They asked where I was from and what I was doing here. They were amazed to hear I walked from Rotterdam. So, there we were, in the middle of a deserted area, guided by Google Maps, which still indicated we could cross the military area. Which we didn’t. I came up with an alternative, to go to Letzlingen and ask further instructions there. They also went in that direction and so we wished each other a good and safe trip.'

After asking there, I realized crossing the military area was an absolute no-go. Time to improvise. I walked to a gas station to ask the personnel there if they knew a way to get to my destination. A man, Arnold, who happened to just have had lunch overheard our conversation and he said I could ride with him to Hüttel and on to Colbitz, where I could walk north to Tangerhütte.'

When I was about 3km from my destination, Google Maps said I needed to take a left turn. But, there was nothing. Just a wheat field and a small strip of bare soil that could not be called a road. I had two options, walk back one kilometer, or go on and walk through high grass and wheat. Of course I chose the latter…'
