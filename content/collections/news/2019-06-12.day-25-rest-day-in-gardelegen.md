Since today was a resting day, I took that time to visit a memorial site of a massacre that took place just outside of the town of Gardelegen. 1016 people were forced to walk to a barn, where they were brutally killed. It was a 4km walk, and along the route were small memorial stones, with the date this occurred, April 13th, 1945.'
