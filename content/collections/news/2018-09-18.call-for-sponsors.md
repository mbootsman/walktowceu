Walk to WordCamp Europe is a private initiative.

Because I'm self employed I need to ensure my business still runs after this adventure. I need to hire people to help my customers during my absence. 

As a sponsor, you are the foundation for this fundraising project and will make it possible for me to keep running my business during my absence. And that is highly appreciated.

Sponsors of all sizes are welcome, small businesses, large corporations or freelancers, every sponsor can find their best-fit package.

Want to become a sponsor?

Go to the [sponsor packages](/sponsoring/) page, and fill in the form on the bottom.

Thanks!
