        text: 'Barsinghausen was the goal today. I planned this route and the total distance was 36km. That changed a bit, I walked 40,5 to get there. This happened because I took a different route than the one that was planned. I decided I had to walk though towns in stead of along a busy road with no houses / businesses, all because of the problems I had the day before, and to be able to get help if needed.'

Except, that was closed. I met a cyclist there and he told me there was detour. No problem, my body still felt good, and on I went. Though towns like Lahde, a forest named Schaumburger Wald, Meerbeck and after about 19k I arrived in Stadthagen. I was hungry and decided to have lunch at Gaststätte Bruns. It was about to close for the afternoon so I quickly ordered a salad and sat inside. After a few bites, I saw a familiar car show up on the parking lot. My mom and dad came to visit me, and they had booked a hotel for a few nights in Hannover. That was so cool, and really motivated me more to finish today’s stage.'

I refilled my water bottle when I could, so that I would not run out of water. Furthermore the weather was not too hot for a hike. It all felt good.'

So she proposed to pick me up in Barsinghausen, so I could sleep and eat at her place. The next morning she’ll bring me back to Barsinghausen, so I can walk to Hannover and not cheat by completing a piece of the route to Berlin by car.'
