        text: 'After waking up too early again, I turned around a slept for another hour or so. When I woke up again I first took a shower in my private guest bathroom. Together with Lisa and her son Jonathan I had breakfast. She had prepared freshly baked bread and a nice cup of tea. Sadly I could not say goodbye to Sebastian, as he left for work early. I packed my bag and left a thank you postcard, as I do in every place I have slept. Now I was ready for my next stage, to Wolfsburg.'
