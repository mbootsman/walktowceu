Within a few kilometers I had to shorten my pants, since it felt really warm. I kept on walking for about 11km and realized I had not taken a serious break. That is, more than 3 minutes, I took to zip off the bottom parts of my pants.'

I had my first break. After 22km. I was amazed. Mu body is changing, getting stronger, and I could not believe that had been walking for 3,5 hours with no break. I continued my trip and exited the road along the channel. I was out of water.'

I asked if they could help me with some water, and the gladly helped. They also offered me a bottle of beer, but I rejected that, too heavy ðŸ˜‰'

But there was nothing. Just grass, a bit shorter grass, which was supposed to be the track. It was only 500 meter, so I took that path. I came out with red legs, because of some grass allergy I have, and red knees, because of some nettles. (As Iâ€™m typing this, all of these irritations are gone)'

I went to the hotel terrace and there I met Florian and Jens. Florian is one of the founders from Mittwald and Jens is the head of customer service. We had a great chat and they invited my to join them for diner in the city center. So, for the first time in about 14 days, I stepped inside a car. We had a great meal at the local steakhouse, after which Florian took me to a huge supermarket to get some protein bars and sport drink for my walk tomorrow.'
