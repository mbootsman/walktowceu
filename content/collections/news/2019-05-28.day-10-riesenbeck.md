        text: 'After putting my backpack on, which was definitely much lighter after I ditched some stuff, I started walking. I chose to wear my jacket, since rain was predicted on my route. After about an hour and a half, after walking through beautiful fields, it started raining. I did not yet protect my backpack with it’s own raincoat, so I immediately did. And continued walking. The pace was pretty good, and before I knew I had covered 7km already. The rain did not slow me down. After a while it stopped raining and my pants started to dry. It was a bit wet, but not so bad.'

        text: 'Rain gained up on me, and started in a heavier form. I was not letting it keep me from walking, and just kept going on. Nothing I could do about it, so better just deal with it. I stopped at a bus stop to shelter and to dry (just my pants). When the third car drove by and through a puddle of water next to the bus stop, I knew I had to move. So I continued to find another place to shelter. After a few kilometers, I found one. I waited until it nearly stopped raining and continued my way.'

        text: 'With about 6km to go, I walked on a road in the forest. A car stopped next to me, and a friendly elderly couple asked if I wanted to hitch a ride. I declined, and thanked them for the offer. I can only walk to Berlin, and not hitch rides. That’s what I’ve promised my sponsors and donors and that’s what I should do. At 5pm I got to Riesenbeck, and had to wait an half hour for the host to get home, my bad, I walked too fast….'
