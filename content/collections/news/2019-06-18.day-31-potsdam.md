I know my body operates well in temperatures in the 25 degrees Celsius range, but walking 30 kilometers with a 10kg backpack is another thing. I just wanted to be ready before the temperature hits itâ€™s highest value today.'

I thought about getting in the water, to take a swim, but I didnâ€™t do it. Just kept on walking. From Geltow it was just a few kilometers to get to Potsdam.'
