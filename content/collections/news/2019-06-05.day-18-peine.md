When that was done I could take a seat in the waiting area. The most depressing waiting area I’ve ever seen. Just white walls, hard chairs an some local magazines. But hey, I had an appointment at 9:15am, so it was almost my turn.'

Those seconds became minutes and finally the doctor came in and asked what was wrong. I explained the whole story as he wrote it all down.'

His diagnosis was that I had a overloaded right ankle, and I have to give it some rest, do some exercises with it, and have more breaks while I am walking. I told him I was a happy man and he wrapped my ankle in a bandage for some extra support, while asking me some more things about my walk. We shook hands, and I was on may way again.'
