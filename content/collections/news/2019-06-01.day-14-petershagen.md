I managed to get 1 hour more sleep, and then took a shower and went down to the breakfast lounge. I was the first one, or maybe it wasn’t really busy in the hotel.'

        text: '. A walk of around 26km. No problem considering the walk from yesterday, which went great and without problems. I left around 8am and the temperature was still below 20 degrees Celsius, great for walking. I felt a pain in my right leg that I did not know. I’ve had some pains during walking, but they were mainly from blisters. This was different. After 4km I took a little break, and after 10 minutes I continued. When I walked around 9km the pain was back and more painful. I considered stopping, but did continue, to get to the 50% mark. And I did, I walked 375km in total since May 19th.'

So, something was definitely wrong. My guess is that it is an allergic reaction gone bad. I have walk through high grass yesterday and that usually gives me red rash for a while. But not this bad.'

I walked to the passenger door and this friendly guy Heinrich took me in, and brought me to Petershagen. A trip that took is about 10 minutes. In those ten minutes we discussed our families, my adventure, our work, and we missed the exit to Petershagen…'

The red rash was almost gone and so was the pain. It was still a bit sore, but it looked promising. At the time I’m typing this, 8pm, I’ve applied the creme a second time. Hopefully a good night sleep together with the creme will do some magic.'

Around 2:30pm the reporter was there, and I explained the situation and told her about me experiences so far. We took a few pictures for the website and the article in the paper and that was it. So cool to do, and let the local readers know I am, or was, here.'
