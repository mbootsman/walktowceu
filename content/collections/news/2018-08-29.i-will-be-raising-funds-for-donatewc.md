Today Berlin was announced as the city for [WordCamp Europe 2019](https://2019.europe.wordcamp.org/).

So, it's time to start planning. The long distance path [E11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E11_European_long_distance_path) will be used as base for the walking trip.Â  More news later.I just opened up the donate page. You can choose to donate for [DonateWC](https://donatewc.org/), or sponsor me personally to buy some bratwurst along the way. Share this with all your friends, colleagues, clients, family members, pets.

Thanks for donating and I hope to see you in Berlin.
