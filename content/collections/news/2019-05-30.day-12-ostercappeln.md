I rang the doorbell and Daniel and his girlfriend Eli opened the door, and I was welcomed inside. I took a quick shower and we had a few cups of tea. Eli had been living in the UK for four years, so tea was in her system. When it was time for diner, Daniel called a local restaurant, and we walked to it. Then Daniel realized he saw a guy with a white shirt, and some other people site on the town square, and thought it was me. And it was. Yes, I saw them walking and kissing.'
