She said that I could not sit there, and it was their house. I tried to explain that I was just waiting, and did not want to make any trouble. So I kindly asked if I could site there. She walked away and nodded something.'

I dropped my bag there, and was invited to the kitchen because diner was being prepared. We had a drink in the kitchen, and then it was time for the starer. An asparagus soup with German sausages. It was very good, and also the main course was pretty good, it was a Swäbische Maultasche and like the soup, it was all home made. For desert there was a strawberry cheesecake, and after that, I was done. Or as the Germans say “Ich war satt”.'
