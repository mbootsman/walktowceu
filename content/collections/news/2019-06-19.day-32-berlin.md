Since it was going to be 30+ degrees Celsius today, Caspar and I agreed that he was going to be awake around 5am, so we could start early and enjoy the fresh outside temperatures. And so we did.'

We took a little detour to take a look at an old bridge that used to be a border checkpoint when the wall was there. We walked in the nature until Telkow, there we entered the urban area.'

        text: 'For our last break, we sat down on a bench under a highway bride. In the shade. The temperature had really gone up, and we really needed to cool down, drink some water and apply some more sunscreen. When we were ready, there was just 4km to go. The first part of the last phase we really walked together, but the more I came to the Estrel Hotel, the faster I was walking. Caspar said it was OK to continue with the faster pace, so that‚Äôs what I did. When I arrived on the bridge across the hotel I booked for my stay in Berlin, my son came running towards me. We had the best hug ever, and then the rest of my family joined me. Daughter, wife, my parents, in-laws, and my niece.'

We took a train to the Ostbahnhof to watch a piece of the wall. After taking some pictures there and telling our children what this wall was and meant for the inhabitants of Berlin, we went back to the hotel. I was getting tired.'
