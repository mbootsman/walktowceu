The first encounter really made me jump, because a deer was right next to me in a wheat field, and it decided to cross my path and run away. Of course I was too slow to make a picture or video if it. The second time I saw the deer standing at a distance of 20 meters, and decided to make a picture of it. When I got closer after I took the picture it vanished in the wheat field.'
