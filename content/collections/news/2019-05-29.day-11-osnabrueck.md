Signs of a good sleep. After having breakfast with Maria and Sabine, I packed my bag, said goodbye and started walking, to Osnabrück.'

Just 256 steps up. Well, I’m glad I followed this tip by Maria. What a view. You can see the picture in the gallery below.'

        text: 'I continued my way to the first town, Ibbenbüren. I made it a habit to look at the distance it takes to the next town/village, and not look at the number of kilometers to go for the whole route. This works best for me. Well, except for the last part of a stage, then I really countdown the last kilometers. I walk through hills, along a railway track, on the side of roads were cars drive too fast (yes, I’m in Germany, and no, not all Germans drive like that) and I stopped in a village Laggenbeck to have lunch, after I made a nice picture of the church there. A tuna salad was served, and I had a little talk with the owner. He was calling me insane to be walking to Berlin. And yet he wished me luck, and showed his respect for me. A very motivating gesture.'

I had 9 km to go, all the way to the east side. It was hard, warm and my feet felt tired. But, I didn’t give in to the pain, I didn’t give up, and around 5:45pm I pressed the doorbell, just after I made a “I’ve arrived selfie”.'

Then we had a real Osnabrück beer, Rampendahl. It was so good! Silke had been preparing dinner, and after dinner I was too tired. I needed sleep. I excused myself, put my legs up, got into bed, an started typing. And here’s the result.'
