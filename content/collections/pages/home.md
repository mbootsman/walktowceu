On May 19th, 2019 I started my fundraiser walk for DonateWC.

On June 19th I arrived in Berlin after I  walked 718.7km to [WordCamp Europe](https://2019.europe.wordcamp.org/) from my hometown Berkel en Rodenrijs. Check my route [here](/route).

**Why did I walk from my home to Berlin?**
Well, for three reasons:
- To raise funds for DonateWC
- To go beyond my own comfort zone
- To have fun and meet friends along the way

It all started with a [tweet](https://marcelbootsman.nl/tweets/1003666255994376192/).
![Iâ€™m thinking about walking to the next #WCEU. Needs some planning of course, and funding / sponsoring. Will launch a separate website after this years edition.](/assets/content/walk-to-wceu-tweet.png)
