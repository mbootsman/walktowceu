Thank you for considering to donate.

Walk to WordCamp Europe has ended, please donate directly on the [DonateWC](https://donatewc.org/) site.

## Donations

A total of **€8283** has been donated (This amount is the total amount of donations minus the payment provider transaction fees).

## Why I chose DonateWC


[DonateWC](https://donatewc.org/) was founded by [Ines van Essen](https://twitter.com/motherofcode). And since she started it, I was a fan of this initiative.

DonateWC is an initiative that aims to provide people with lesser financial means with funds to get to a (big) WordCamp. From donations that we collect, we’ll provide deserving community members with the following:

- A WordCamp ticket
- Door to door transportation
- Accommodation
- Food and drink money
- Internet access
- A once-in-a-lifetime experience

Helping people with financial challenges to attend a WordCamp is something that strengthens the community and brings people together. By raising funds for DonateWC, I am helping these people, and support the WordPress community (which I have been doing for a while in other areas the last years).
