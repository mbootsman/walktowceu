On May 19th, I will walk to Berlin to raise funds for [DonateWC](https://donatewc.org/).

Because I'm self employed, I need to ensure my business still runs after this adventure. I need to hire a replacement to help my customers during my absence. 

As a sponsor, you are the foundation for this fundraising project and will make it possible for me to keep running my business during my absence. And that is highly appreciated.

Sponsor or donate?
------------------

Let's first explain the differences between sponsoring and donating. Donations are gifts, and the funds that are donated will be transferred to DonateWC upon arrival in Berlin. If you want to donate as a company, just do so at the [donate](/donate/) page. Donations are anonymous. I will not share who donated and how much they donated.

I will be walking for 32 days. Of those 32 days, 22 days are working days, and it will cost me around €5000 (and hopefully less) to find a full time replacement. If you would like to attach your brand to Walk To WordCamp Europe and help make this adventure a success, you can sponsor me. I will do something in return for you, as you can see in the package descriptions below.

**If the total costs are lower than the amount of  sponsorship funds, the remaining funds will be added to the DonateWC donation.**
